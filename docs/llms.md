# OHIF Viewer

> OHIF (Open Health Imaging Foundation) Viewer is an open-source, web-based, zero-footprint DICOM viewer platform designed for medical imaging. It provides a highly configurable and extensible framework for building diagnostic quality medical imaging applications. OHIF Viewer supports various imaging formats (primarily DICOM), offers advanced visualization tools, customizable workflows, and integration capabilities with different data sources.

The OHIF Viewer is built with a modular architecture that includes extensions, modes, and services.
